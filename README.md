Community Health Workers Application
===

The Community Health Workers Application is designed to facilitate the publication of CEU classes for CHWs. This application helps CEUs find training centers and courses that are available to them to get CEU credits.

This project is a fork of VolunteerManagementApp located [here](https://github.com/DataAnalyticsinStudentHands/VolunteerManagementApp).

### Development Prerequisites
- bower `npm install -g bower`
- gulp `npm install -g gulp`
- npm packages `npm install`

### Getting Started
1. Run `npm install`. This uses `package.js` to install local dependencies.
2. Run `gulp setup`. This runs common setup tasks, especially `bower install` using bower.json.
2. Run `ionic serve`. This uses `ionic.xml` and will serve as local node server. Live updates when you make changes to the code.

### How to Build Mobile Apps
1. Run `gulp android-setup` or `gulp ios-setup` this uses the Gulpfile.js to automate cordova, plugin, and build.
2. Run `gulp android-build` or `gulp ios-build` for subsequent updates to the code and resources.
3. Run `cordova run android` or  open the `*.xcodeproj` file generated by cordova for iOS.

### Building for Production
Follow instructions [here](https://github.com/DataAnalyticsinStudentHands/DASH-Documentation/blob/master/Code%20Development/Frontend/How-to-Build-Mobile-Applications-for-Production.md).

### Deploying to Web
This repository is configured to deploy to Housuggest `gulp deploy-prod` and HnetDev `gulp deploy-dev` remote sites. Additional documentation [here](https://github.com/DataAnalyticsinStudentHands/DASH-Documentation/blob/master/Code%20Development/Frontend/App-Deployment-to-web-server.md).

###Changes after fork from VolunteerManagementApp
- Added Core Competencies
- Locations and Classes are newly added.

##Unit Testing:

1. Testing is done with Jasmine and Karma running in node.js
2. To install nodejs: https://nodejs.org/download/
3. Open the nodejs console.
2. To install Karma: `npm install -g karma`
3. To install Jasmine: `npm install -g jasmine`
4. If the testing environment is already set up, navigate to root directory and run `karma start karma.config.js`. The unit tests are located in the 'tests' folder and named *.test.js.  
5. If the testing environment hasn't been created yet: 
   Create a new karma config file: `karma init my.config.js`
   Please ensure that the following content matches the questions the config file asks for.

    > tests/required-files/angular-mocks.js
    > **/*.test.js
    > **/www/js/*.js 
    >
    
    Should any of the files included by the previous patterns be excluded ?
    You can use glob patterns, eg. "**/*.swp".

   1. Pro AngularJS. - Freeman, Adam. - ISBN: 978-1-4302-6448-4
   2. http://toddmotto.com/ultimate-guide-to-learning-angular-js-in-one-day/
   3. https://docs.angularjs.org/tutorial/step_02 (Read the sections entitled 'Tests')
   4. http://www.yearofmoo.com/2013/01/full-spectrum-testing-with-angularjs-and-karma.html
   
####Tips:
   1. Ensure that once the karma browser of choice is launched that you do not minimize said browser. This will substantially slow down testing time. 
   2. For headless browser testing try PhantomJS.
